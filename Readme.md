# Insight & Reflection Section

**An LLM-powered tool for analyzing quarterly 10-Q reports from public companies using LangChain and Streamlit. 
During development, I experimented with various LLM models including `google/flan-t5-base` and `google/flan-t5-small`. The smaller model offered faster responses but with slightly reduced detail, while the base model provided more detailed answers.

Switching from FAISS to Chroma for vector storage solved deployment challenges related to system dependencies, improving app reliability in cloud environments.

- Extract key financial, operational, and risk insights from SEC 10-Q reports
- Built with LangChain for document processing and Hugging Face Transformers for natural language understanding
- Intuitive Streamlit UI for uploading PDFs and querying reports interactively
- Utilizes Chroma vector store for efficient document retrieval
- Choose between FLAN-T5-Small (faster, less detailed) and FLAN-T5-Base (slower, more detailed) directly in the app sidebar.
